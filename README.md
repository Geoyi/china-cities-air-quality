## Air Quality Index History of Major China Cities
Python version scraper, inspired by [`@feelinglucky`](https://github.com/feelinglucky) and [`his project`](http://www.gracecode.com/aqi.html).<br><br>
The data has already been crawled and stored in the file `AQI.csv`, ranging from 2000-6-5 to 2015-3-27. There are three columns in it, namely `City`, `AQI`, `Date`(very easy to understand). If you wish to get this updated, please run the scraper and enter correct dates.<br>
